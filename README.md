## Documentation
Documentation can be found [here](https://godoc.org/github.com/ricochet2200/go-disk-usage/du) and there is a [short example](https://github.com/ricochet2200/go-disk-usage/blob/master/duexample.go) of how to use this library.

## Compatibility
This works for Windows, MacOS, Linux and **FreeBSD** although there may some minor variability between what this library reports and what you get from `df`.
